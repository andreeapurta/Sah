# Tweedle chess
Also known as twin orthodox chess or double-king chess

- each player has two kings and two queens 
- 10Ã—10 board 
- A player wins by checkmating either one of the opposing kings

### Game rules
The normal chess rules apply, except that kings and rooks can only castle "short" (i.e. with kings shifting two squares toward the nearest corner), and pawns can move one or two steps at any stage.

### Comments
"While his pair of Queens will provide the player's main hopes for victory, his twin monarchs King Tweedledee and King Tweedledum jointly provide his sequence of headaches!" (Parton 1961:14) Parton makes note that the only way a player can escape mate from a fork on his two kings is by capturing the checking piece

Boyer remarked that the variant yields "magnificent games" because there are two directions of attack and two points to defend.

### The rules for castling
- castling is only possible if neither the king nor the rook has moved
- there must not be any pieces between the king and the rook
- the king may not be in check
- the square the king goes to and any intervening squares may not be under attack
- however, there is nothing to prevent castling if the rook is under attack
